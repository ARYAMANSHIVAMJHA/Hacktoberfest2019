Guess A Number!

To use this little bash script open a terminal window and navigate to the folder containing the Guess.sh file. There are a few parameters that will have to be entered before you can run the script. The parameters include the number range that you can guess and the number of tries you allow yourself to guess. For example, if I wanted to guess a number between 1 and 200 and allow myself 10 tries I would type the following to run the script: 

bash Guess.sh 1 200 10

In this instance the "1" is the minimum number, the "200" is the maximum number and the "10" is the number of guesses to be allowed. When attempting to guess the number you will be prompted to enter a number and when making a wrong guess you will be told to guess higher or lower.
